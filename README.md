# Home Assistant Rsync Backup add-on

This repository is intended to host a Home Assistant add-on that syncs Home Assistant backups to a remote host using `rsync` over SSH.

Initially it defines a single add-on:

- `rsync-backup/` – sync the `/backup` directory from Home Assistant OS to a remote machine using SSH keys.

## Repository layout

- `rsync-backup/`
  - `config.yaml` – Home Assistant add-on manifest
  - `Dockerfile` – container image build for the add-on
  - `run.sh` – container entrypoint that runs rsync in a loop

## High-level design

- The add-on mounts the Home Assistant backup directory (`/backup`) read-only.
- It connects to a configured remote host with `rsync` over SSH.
- SSH keys can be either generated by the add-on on first start or provided via configuration.
- The add-on polls for new/changed backups on a configurable interval and syncs them to the remote path.

More detailed configuration and logic can be refined as the implementation evolves.
